50) ***The BrokenConnection needs to be a class and inhereit one of the built-in Python classes
    Will be raised if too many consecutive corrupted files are created

    class BrokenConnection(Exception)

        def __init__(self, file_name):
            super().__init__()
            self.file_name = file_name

        def __str__(self):
            print(f'{self.file_name} is possibly corrupted')

        def __repr__(self):
            return repr(...)


53) Properly create logger for CreateZip function
55) Function that sends the data to an SQL Database
59) Look into multi-threading for the CreateZip() and check_results() functions
61) Something is wrong with the 2018-19 data
64) Restructure the create_categories code (This is currently 300+ lines of code. Shorten this)
65) Restructure the quarterly_yearly code
67) Build multithreading function for extract_re_data and njr10k
68) Restructure pdf_generator to accept an arguement to be useful in multithreading
69) Create a function called waiting which will take use trhe datetime and time module to put the program
to sleep for a specified amount of time.
if Scraper.event_log[Scraper.no_of_runs]['Run Time'] <= todays_date
    if todays_date <= Next_month:
        waiting(time difference between today and next month)
    elif todays_date => Next month:
        waiting(24 hours)
70) Create an infinite loop so the program never ends
68) Add a except KeyboardInterupt and sys.exit() for this exception
45) If the program is killed due to an exception, I want to be be able to rerun the program X number of times
47) Create a function that states "if too many consecutive corrupt files are created, kill program"
14) Create variables for the December data scrape?
    I actually need to create a whole new function just for this?
19) Change the NJR10k logger directory to my Python Folder
27) See where list comprehension or generators can be used in the program
34) Send text message to phone once the program completes with a summary of what occurred

8-4-23 Most recent updates (put in main file at home):
1) Put this in the for-loop in the main program to print better tables of the data
print(tabulate(main_dictionary['2018'], headers = 'keys', tablefmt = 'plain'))
print()
print(tabulate(main_dictionary['2019'], headers = 'keys', tablefmt = 'plain'))
print()
print(tabulate(main_dictionary['2020'], headers = 'keys', tablefmt = 'plain'))
print()
print(tabulate(main_dictionary['2021'], headers = 'keys', tablefmt = 'plain'))
print()
print(tabulate(main_dictionary['2022'], headers = 'keys', tablefmt = 'plain'))
print()
print(tabulate(main_dictionary['2023'], headers = 'keys', tablefmt = 'plain'))

2) The shelve files (.bak, .dir, and .dat are getting sent tot different folders. Take os.chdir(old_dir) out of the with loop
3) Read the event log at the end of the logger file and put it into the Scraper class
4) New OrganizeFiles class (make sure to seperate .pdf and the logger files)
