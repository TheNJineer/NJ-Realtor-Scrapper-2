PRIORITY:
******I need to subscribe to CJMLS and Bright MLS for all municipal sales data
*** Go through and delete all unnecessary/unused functions

127) Update pandas2sql's SQLAlchemy info for the right connection (DONE)
128) Create main2() function which implements SQL instead of Excel (DONE)
    - Delete, not pulling full year data anymore
    - Create ncjar_fy_sales_data in PostgreSql
    - The following columns in the fy dict doesnt hold any data:
        - Inventory of Homes for Sales
        - Inventory of Homes for Sales %(YoY)
        - Months of Supply
        - Months of Supply %(YoY)
129) Make sure all python dicts are combined if multiple year's data is extracted
132) Update the pdf_generator elif type(pdfname) is list logic
133) *** The update_nj10k function doesnt know how to scrape from the end of a year to a new one with the current logic
                for y in years:

                    months1 = months[months.index(start_month1): months.index(current_month1) + 1]
                    for m in months1:

                    *** I may need to create a dictionary to hold what months from what year need to be scraped
90) Make sure CreateZip runs as intended and the os.walk goes through all directories then set logger messages
    - Current function doesnt work. Raises error
124) Make sure the NJScrapper main function is updated to account for the arg updates made for extract_re_data, good_data, duplicate_check, etc (DONE)
125) Ensure cls.state_dictionary is pulling from the most recent Excel file/SQL table (DONE)
    - Ensure it pulling from the correct excel file (NOT NECESSARY)
    - Ensure cls.state_dictionary is doing what I want it to do (WORKS FINE)
126) Create clean_db function which cleans the pandas db before saving in SQL/Excel (DONE)
121) Refactor update_njr10k and corrupted_files using the new function from above
    - Also, take out the try-except blocks from these functions. There are no known exceptions we want to allow in these functions (DONE)
    - Update the logic for both functions. They are outdated/make no sense
115) pandas2excel no longer uploads separate dbs by year, just an all months and all years db (DONE)
    - Also add logic to add new data to previous file and save under new name rather than saving the whole python dict to a new file every time (NOT NECESSARY)
    - Make sure to clean the python dicts of all counties == 'N/A' (DONE)
    - Be sure to pull from SQL instead of latest excel file (NOT NECESSARY)
    - May need to add a depreciation warning on this function
107) Refactor the code so I'm not loading the full db from EXCEL/SQL. Append newly scrape info to SQL DB
71) Function that sends the data to an SQL Database
    - Create pandas2sql (DONE)
        - First create a new script which will send the latest Excel db to SQL
        - Second, create the above function which updates the current table of data already located in SQL (DONE)
109) Add doc-strings to all the methods of the class


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


110) Clean all the strong and weak warning and format to PEP standards
72) ***Look into aiohttp for async http requesting
- asyncio is pretty difficult to use
- there's something about the async setup that mixing up the split function for the cities with duplicate names
- the download pdf function isnt downloading anything
73) asynio Exceptions to my try-except blocks which use the module
79) Check back in a few days to determine campaign registration status on Twilio.com or email
80) Create decorator functions for these tasks:
    ***Use functool.wrapper to keep the metadata
 - Logger decorator function for:
    ***Change the logger level depending on the function running if possible
    ***May need to have "logger" as an arg to use in the function
    - CreateZip (properly place logger messages in function)
45) If the program is killed due to an exception, I want to be able to rerun the program X number of times
